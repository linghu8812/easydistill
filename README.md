### System 1 Models

**DistilQwen2** is an enhanced version of the Qwen2 models, equipped with improved instruction-following capabilities for various NLP tasks. We employ GPT-4 and Qwen-max as teacher models to generate high-quality responses, with the balance on the task distributions of input instructions. Following SFT, a rank optimization process is performed using the DPO algorithm to enhance alignment between the student models and the teacher models. **DistilQwen2.5** models are trained using a combination of black-box and white-box KD algorithms. We adhere to the same instruction data processing and black-box SFT procedure as employed in the production of **DistilQwen2**. Subsequently, white-box training is applied to refine the students' acquisition of intricate knowledge from the teacher models, specifically utilizing Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct as open-source teacher models. The performance of **DistilQwen2** and **DistilQwen2.5** is shown below.

We have released two instruction following datasets to public. Refer to the Datasets section.


### System 2 Models

The **DistilQwen2.5-R1** model series utilizes DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model. To align the reasoning abilities of smaller distilled models with their intrinsic cognitive capacities, the models are further refined using our CogPO algorithm, which outperforms other training methods. Additionally, we transfer the fast-thinking reasoning capabilities from DeepSeek-V3-0324 to the **DistilQwen2.5-DS3-0324** models. To shorten the reasoning process, the CoT simplification operator are employed to reduce the number of tokens in the training data for **DistilQwen2.5-R1**. Combined with a rewritten dataset comprising DeepSeek-V3-0324's CoT distillation data, we develop the **DistilQwen2.5-DS3-0324** models. The performance of **DistilQwen2.5-R1** and **DistilQwen2.5-DS3-0324** is shown below.

## Released Datasets

We have also released several datasets based on the **EasyDistill** framework.

### Instruction Following Datasets

To assist community developers in avoiding catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the **DistilQwen** model, we have open-sourced two datasets: **DistilQwen_100K** and **DistilQwen_1M**. These datasets are intended to provide a solid foundation for model fine-tuning, enhancing adaptability to new tasks while retaining performance on previous tasks. Additionally, it can be utilized to improve instruction-following capabilities when fine-tuning other similar large language models. These datasets cover a range of contents, including mathematics, code, knowledge-based Q&A, instruction following, and creative generation, with a total dataset size of 100K and 1M entries. Users can integrate **DistilQwen_100K** and **DistilQwen_1M**, or its subsets, with their own data during model fine-tuning to ensure excellent downstream task performance while maintaining the model's general capabilities, thus preserving its ability to generalize.


### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Datasets

**OmniThought** is a large-scale dataset featuring **2 million** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes generated and validated by DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. Each CoT process in **OmniThought** is annotated with novel Reasoning Verbosity (RV) and Cognitive Difficulty (CD) scores, which describe the appropriateness of CoT verbosity and cognitive difficulty level for models to comprehend these reasoning processes. Based on our **OmniThought** dataset, we further train and release a series of high-performing models (**DistilQwen-ThoughtX-7B** and **DistilQwen-ThoughtX-32B**), specifically equipped with stronger reasoning abilities and optimal CoT output length and difficulty level. Refer to `recipes/open_datasets` for details. In addition, **OmniThought-0528** is an extension to **OmniThought** featuring **365 thousand** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes generated and validated by DeepSeek-R1-0528. 

All the datasets are publicly available in HuggingFace and ModelScope.
